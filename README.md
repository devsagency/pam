# Pam

Php Approachable Microframework



# Installation

To install via Composer :

$ composer require pjs/pam



# Overview

Pam is a microframework PHP based on MVC architecture.

Pam is very easy to use & very light to implement.

The Model part can be used for all CRUD actions and doesn't need to be overloaded for basic actions.

The View part uses the template engine Twig, so it's possible to use variables, fonctions, filters, etc...

The Controller part inherit from the main controller some very useful fonctions & the FrontController structure the application with action methods.

Sessions are managed by Pam for log, user & message actions.

DataBase access is managed too obviously, through the PDO class.
